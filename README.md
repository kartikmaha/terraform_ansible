📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on:

🏗️ Provisioning infrastructure using Terraform

⚙️ Configuring servers using Ansible

🌍 Supporting multiple environments (e.g., dev, stage, prd)

🔄 Creating a reusable and modular DevOps workflow using GitHub Actions

---

🛠️ Technical Stack

☁️ Cloud → AWS (EC2, VPC, SG, IAM)

🏗️ IaC → Terraform

⚙️ Config Management → Ansible

🔄 CI/CD → GitHub Actions

📦 Containerization → Docker

📈 Deployment Workflow

🔹 1. Code Push

🚀 Developer pushes updates to GitHub.
    
🔄 GitHub Actions triggers the deploy.yml workflow.

🔹 2. Build & Registry

🏗️ GitHub Actions builds a Multi-stage Docker image.

📦 Image is pushed to Docker Hub with the :latest tag.

🔹 3. Infrastructure Provisioning

🏗️ Terraform initializes and applies the plan.

🌐 AWS resources (EC2/VPC) are verified or created.

📡 Output returns the dynamic EC2 Public IP.

🔹 4. Configuration & Deployment

⚙️ Ansible installs Docker on the fresh instance.

🔑 User permissions and Docker groups are configured.

🚀 The Docker image is pulled and run with restart: always policy.

🔹 5. Live Access

🌐 Dashboard becomes accessible at the public IP on Port 80.
