### 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on:

🏗️ Provisioning infrastructure using Terraform

⚙️ Configuring servers using Ansible

🌍 Supporting multiple environments (e.g., dev, stage, prd)

🔄 Creating a reusable and modular DevOps workflow using GitHub Actions

### 🛠️ Technical Stack

☁️ Cloud → AWS (EC2, VPC, SG, IAM)

🏗️ IaC → Terraform

⚙️ Config Management → Ansible

🔄 CI/CD → GitHub Actions

📦 Containerization → Docker

### 📈 Deployment Workflow

🔹 1. Code Push

Developer pushes code to GitHub

GitHub Actions triggers the workflow

🔹 2. Build & Push

Docker image is built using multi-stage build

Image is pushed to Docker Hub

🔹 3. Infrastructure Provisioning

Terraform provisions/updates AWS resources

EC2 public IP is generated dynamically

🔹 4. Configuration & Deployment

Ansible installs and configures Docker

Latest container is pulled and started

🔹 5. Access

Application is available via EC2 public IP (Port 80)

### 📈 Future Improvements

🔐 Add basic security scanning (Trivy / Checkov)

🔄 Improve CI workflow with validations (linting, formatting)

📦 Use versioned Docker image tags instead of latest

⚙️ Add environment-specific configs (dev/prod separation)
